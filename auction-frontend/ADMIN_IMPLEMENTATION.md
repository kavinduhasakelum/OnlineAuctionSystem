## API Integration

All components use the centralized `api.js` configuration:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:5140/api`
- JWT token automatically included in requests
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Authorization
All admin endpoints require:
- Valid JWT token in Authorization header
- User role must be "Admin"
- API returns 401/403 for unauthorized access

## Routes Summary

| Route | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `/admin/home` | AdminHome | Main admin landing page with quick stats |
| `/admin/users` | ManageUsers | User management interface |
| `/admin/auctions` | ManageAuctions | Auction/product management interface |
| `/admin/dashboard` | AdminDashboard | System statistics and analytics |

---

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
1. Backend API running on `http://localhost:5140`
2. Admin user account created in database
3. JWT authentication configured

### Running the Application
```bash
cd auction-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Testing Admin Features
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Navigate through the admin sections
3. Test each functionality:
   - Approve/reject pending products
   - Change user roles
   - View dashboard statistics
   - Delete products/users

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access:** All admin routes protected with PrivateRoute wrapper
2. **API Authorization:** Backend validates admin role on every request
3. **Self-Protection:** Prevents admins from modifying their own accounts
4. **Audit Trail:** All actions logged on backend with admin ID
5. **Confirmation Required:** Destructive actions require user confirmation

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Activity Logs:** View detailed admin action history
2. **Bulk Actions:** Select multiple users/products for batch operations
3. **Advanced Filters:** Date ranges, price ranges, etc.
4. **Export Data:** Download reports in CSV/PDF format
5. **Email Templates:** Customize notification messages
6. **Analytics Charts:** Visualize statistics with charts
7. **User Communication:** Send messages to users
8. **Suspended Accounts:** Temporarily suspend users instead of deletion

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: API calls fail with 401
**Solution:** Ensure valid JWT token is stored in localStorage and user has Admin role

### Issue: Components don't display data
**Solution:** Check that backend API is running and endpoints are accessible

### Issue: Routes not working
**Solution:** Verify routes are added to App.js and PrivateRoute wrapper is configured

### Issue: Pagination not working
**Solution:** Ensure API returns proper totalPages and totalCount in response
